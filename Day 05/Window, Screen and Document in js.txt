In JavaScript, the terms "window," "screen," and "document" refer to different objects and concepts related to 
the web browser environment. Here's an explanation of each term and their differences:

1. Window:
In the context of JavaScript, the "window" object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded. 
 It is the top-level object that contains the entire browsing context and provides various properties and methods for interacting with it. 
 The "window" object is also the global object in client-side JavaScript, meaning that its properties and methods can be accessed directly without 
 specifying "window" explicitly.

For example, you can use the "window" object to access properties like "window.location" 
(provides information about the current URL), "window.alert()" (displays an alert dialog), 
or "window.setTimeout()" (sets a timer to execute a function after a specified delay).

2. Screen:
The "screen" object in JavaScript represents the user's screen or monitor.
 It provides information about the user's display, such as its dimensions, color depth, 
 and available screen space. The "screen" object is a property of the "window" object, 
 so you can access it using "window.screen".

You can utilize properties like "screen.width" (returns the width of the screen in pixels),
 "screen.height" (returns the height of the screen in pixels), or "screen.availWidth"
  (returns the available width excluding operating system features like the taskbar).

3. Document:
The "document" object represents the web page loaded within the browser window. 
It provides access to the HTML content of the page and allows manipulation of its elements, styles, and 
structure. The "document" object is also a property of the "window" object, and you can access it
 using "window.document" or simply "document".

With the "document" object, you can perform operations like accessing and modifying elements on the page,
 manipulating styles, creating new elements dynamically, handling events, and more. 
 For example, you can use methods like "document.getElementById()" to retrieve an element by its ID,
  "document.createElement()" to create a new element, or "document.querySelector()" to select elements
   using CSS-style selectors.
